# You-ve-Got-Mail-Light
Python &amp; RPi.GPIO script to flash a light when I get an email  

To install this to your Raspberry Pi, put these 2 files in your /bin folder, set permissions to execute for the "mailLight" file, enter your information in "MailLght.py" under user password and host, then just run "mailLight" from anywhere and every time you get an email 5 volts will flash 4 times on the pin closest to the edge of the board and the usb ports (gpio 21), and if there are unread emails, 5 volts will be constantly provided to a pin 9 pins to the right of that one (aka gpio 25) (All conversions can be found at http://openmicros.org/index.php/articles/94-ciseco-product-documentation/raspberry-pi/217-getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-gpio-and-python at the bottom of the page. Led pins can be set by the led variable at the beginning of the file)
